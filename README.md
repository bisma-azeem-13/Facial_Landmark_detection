# Facial_Landmark_detection
This repository contains my personal project code. I worked on Facial Landmark Detection via Webcam,Uploaded Images and Videos.
I also added a "FaceMeshBasics" file that contains commented notes within the code to understand all the basics, building bloacks and working components of this project. Feel free to get help from it. 
Do remeber to mention me in your posts if you find it helpful in any way. My socials are mentioned on my Github homepage.

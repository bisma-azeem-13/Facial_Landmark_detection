# Facial_Landmark_detection
This repository contains my project code. I worked on Facial Landmark Detection via Webcam and uploaded Images and Videos.
I also added a "FaceMeshBasics" file that contains commented notes within the code to help you understand all the basics, building blocks, and working components of this project. Feel free to get help from it. 
Do remember to mention me in your posts if you find it helpful in any way. My socials are mentioned on my Github homepage.
